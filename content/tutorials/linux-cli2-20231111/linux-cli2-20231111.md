# Linux Command Linux Interface(CLI)
The Interface if you've ever opened a command prompt on windows or a terminal on linux you've probably been greated with something that looks like this

More than likely your's will look a little different but these are all the same things a CLI interface running on a terminal. Now how does it work? 

Honestly very simply if we type something on our terminal it the character shows on screen(echo), so we can see what we have typed. If we make a mistake we press backspace and it is erased. Once we are happy with a line we submit it by pressing the enter character.

and the terminal will attempt to run that line as a command. If you follow along at home and type in the following we can display all contents of your current directory. This is like viewing all files in a GUI file manager but we are just viewing them as text instead of as graphics.
```sh
    ls
```
